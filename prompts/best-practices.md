# Code Review Best Practices

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write tests before implementing features (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)
- Each feature should have corresponding test cases
- Test structure: Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use meaningful test descriptions that explain the behavior
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Keep tests independent and idempotent

## SOLID Principles
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Each class/module should have one reason to change
   - Keep functions focused and small (< 20 lines recommended)
   - Extract complex logic into separate services/utilities

2. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - Depend on abstractions, not concretions
   - Use dependency injection
   - Implement IoC (Inversion of Control) containers

## Code Quality Guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep cyclomatic complexity low (â‰¤ 10)
- Document public APIs and complex logic
- Follow consistent code formatting
- Use TypeScript for better type safety
- Implement error handling consistently
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Keep dependencies up to date
